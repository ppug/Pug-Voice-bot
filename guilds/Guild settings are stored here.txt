This folder serves as the bots persistent memory of server-specific settings and configuration, including active channels.

Every guild has its own .json file, named with the guild ID.

If this bot is running, it stores all the same info in memory and reads from that instead, meaning this folder serves more as a live backup which allows it to continue where it left off if the process is restarted.
